# Scenario

> first look the simple scenario.

In this example, we perform

- create a firewall rule. **130.211.0.0/22 and 35.191.0.0/16** is important
- create a NAT gateway
- create a VM, do some configuration (like enable services, and clone some data). *do not delete the storage after the VM is deleted*.
- Create a custom image from the above disk.
- Use this custom image to create the instance template.
- TBD...
