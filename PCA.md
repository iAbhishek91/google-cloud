    - Migrating systems and data to support the solution
    - Licensing mapping
    - Network planning
    - Testing and proof of concept

  - Envisioning future solution improvements. Considerations include:
    - Cloud and technology improvements
    - Business needs evolution
    - Evangelism and advocacy
- *Managing and provisioning a solution Infrastructure*
  - Configuring network topologies. Considerations include:
    - Extending to on-premises (hybrid networking)
    - Extending to a multi-cloud environment that may include GCP to GCP communication
    - Security and data protection
  - Configuring individual storage systems. Considerations include:
    - Data storage allocation
    - Data processing/compute provisioning
    - Security and access management
    - Network configuration for data transfer and latency
    - Data retention and data life cycle management
    - Data growth management
  - Configuring compute systems. Considerations include:
    - Compute system provisioning
    - Compute volatility configuration (preemptible vs. standard)
    - Network configuration for compute nodes
    - Infrastructure provisioning technology configuration (e.g. Chef/Puppet/Ansible/Terraform/Deployment Manager)
    - Container orchestration with Kubernetes
- *Designing for security and compliance*
  - Designing for security. Considerations include:
    - Identity and access management (IAM)
    - Resource hierarchy (organizations, folders, projects)
    - Data security (key management, encryption)
    - Penetration testing
    - Separation of duties (SoD)
    - Security controls (e.g., auditing, VPC Service Controls, organization policy)
    - Managing customer-managed encryption keys with Cloud KMS
  - Designing for compliance. Considerations include:
    - Legislation (e.g., health record privacy, childrenâ€™s privacy, data privacy, and ownership)
    - Commercial (e.g., sensitive data such as credit card information handling, personally identifiable information [PII])
    - Industry certifications (e.g., SOC 2)
    - Audits (including logs)
- *Analyzing and optimizing technical and business processes*
  - Analyzing and defining technical processes. Considerations include:
    - Software development life cycle plan (SDLC)
    - Continuous integration / continuous deployment
    - Troubleshooting / post mortem analysis culture
    - Testing and validation
    - Service catalog and provisioning
    - Business continuity and disaster recovery
  - Analyzing and defining business processes. Considerations include:
    - Stakeholder management (e.g. influencing and facilitation)
    - Change management
    - Team assessment / skills readiness
    - Decision-making process
    - Customer success management
