1. **Cloud platform console**
2. **Cloud SDK/ Cloud shell**
3. **Rest APIs** : many APIs are disable by default for security. Go through the APIs  explorer in the cloud console to enable them. Client libraries are available for using the APIs, hence we need not use the APIs directly. There are two type of APIs
  a. Cloud client Libraries: (google recommended) community owned, and may not have latest features.
  b. Google API Client Libraries: they are open source, generated, Java, Python, JS, PHP, .NET, Go, Node.js RUby, Objective-C, Dart. They are designed for completeness.

4. **Cloud console Mobile app**
