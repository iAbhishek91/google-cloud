# Cloud Source Repositories

- **first way** : use hosted Git repo, less management and less work, but limited control.
- **second way** : self hosted Git repo, more responsibility in managing those repositories.

- with Cloud you have the third way: **Hosted on GCP, managed by google, and protected by IAM rules**
  - we can create any number of private repositories.
  - The code can be pulled in compute engines, App engine and GKE.
  - Also provide a **source viewer**, where we can view the files available in the managed Git repo.
